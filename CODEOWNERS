# Code Owners
# These owners will be the default reviewers for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, they will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
#
# IMPORTANT: The following GitHub teams must be created in the organization before this file will work:
#   - @iSystemDevelopment/maintainers
#   - @iSystemDevelopment/docs-team

#   - @iSystemDevelopment/security-team
#
# To create teams: Organization Settings → Teams → New team
