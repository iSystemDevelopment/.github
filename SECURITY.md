# 🛡️ Security Policy

Welcome to the iSystem Development security policy. We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping our projects safe.

## Our Security Principles

We are committed to:
- **Security-first design** across all repositories
- **Privacy by default** — no telemetry, analytics, or hidden data collection
- **Safe operations** — all destructive or system-modifying code supports "dry run" or "what if" modes

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your responsible disclosure:

- **Please do not** open public issues for security bugs
- **Instead**, report via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/iSystemDevelopment/deep-clean-pro/security/advisories) or email us at [info@isystem.app](mailto:info@isystem.app)
- Check each repository's README for specific reporting templates and details

## Secure Coding Standards

Our development practices include:
- No hardcoded secrets, passwords, or tokens
- Input validation and output sanitization
- Least privilege principle in all operations
- Required security testing (linters, static analysis, PSScriptAnalyzer where relevant)
- Logs must exclude sensitive and personal data

## Policy Enforcement

We maintain security through:
- Automated workflows that check for secrets, unsafe patterns, and license compliance
- Human review for all critical infrastructure or security-impacting changes

## Additional Resources

- [AI_ORCHESTRATION.md](https://github.com/iSystemDevelopment/deep-clean-pro/blob/main/AI_ORCHESTRATION.md) — comprehensive developer and automation guidelines
- Individual repository README files for project-specific details
